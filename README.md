## 📋 Overview
This project is a **Smart Supply Chain Automation** tool designed for SMEs to eliminate manual monitoring.

The system acts as a **"Digital Supervisor"**: it analyzes stock levels via **Pandas**, generates professional **XlsxWriter** reports, and—most importantly—uses the **Telegram Bot API** to send real-time alerts to managers when stock reaches critical levels.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **📱 Real-Time Telegram Alerts:** Integrates with the Telegram Bot API to push instant notifications for "CRITICAL" stock levels directly to mobile devices.
* **🧠 Automated Decision Logic:** Uses vectorized Pandas operations to calculate re-order quantities and categorize urgency (`CRITICAL` vs. `Priority`).
* **💰 Financial Intelligence:** Automatically calculates total procurement budgets in Moroccan Dirham (DH) for executive review.
* **📊 Professional Reporting:** Programmatically generates formatted `.xlsx` Purchase Orders with conditional formatting, custom borders, and currency symbols.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
* **Language:** Python 3.12
* **API Integration:** Telegram Bot API (via `requests`)
* **Data Analysis:** Pandas (Vectorization & DataFrames)
* **Reporting:** XlsxWriter
* **Security:** `python-dotenv` for environment variable management

## ⚙️ Setup & Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
bash
git clone [https://github.com/afwalid37-art/Automated-Inventory-Manager.git](https://github.com/afwalid37-art/Automated-Inventory-Manager.git)

cd Automated-Inventory-Manager



### 2. Install Dependencies

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


### 3. Configure Security (.env)

## 🏃‍♂️ How to Run

**Step 1: Generate Mock Data**
Create a fresh inventory file to test the system.

bash
python generate.py



**Step 2: Run the Manager**
Analyze the stock and trigger alerts.

bash
python restock.py


## ⏰ Automated Deployment (Zero-Touch)
This tool is designed to run silently in the background without human intervention. 
It is configured via **Windows Task Scheduler** to execute automatically on system startup, ensuring managers receive their Telegram alerts and Excel reports the moment they open their laptops.


*You will see a "✅ Alert sent" confirmation in the terminal and receive a notification on your phone.*
